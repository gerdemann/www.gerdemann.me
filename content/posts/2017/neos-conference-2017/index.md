Last Friday and Saturday the first Neos Conference took place. It was as in previous years at the inspiring conference, an awesome one with many good talks, interesting discussions and good food.

The venue was the Hotel Gastwerk in Hamburg, the former gas factory linked from the design to the last year's venue of the Inspiring Conference and offered the perfect setting for this great event.  

The Talks
---------

Let's get to the talks: These were once again high-profile. There was something for the beginners, as well as for advanced participants. Also the Lightning Talks on the second day were a great format with short but informative presentations.

There was even, for all who could not attend, a live stream on Youtube.

##### A round trip through your presentation layer in Neos

This talk by _Dmitri Pisarev_ and _Dominique Feyer_ focuses, as the title suggests, the presentation layer of Neos. Why it is useful to have clear templates and to relocate the logic from Fluid templates to Fusion.

##### Keynote - Messages over Structure

The last talk of the first day was held by _Mathias Verraes_. It was again about the subject of event sourcing and CQRS. His recommendation in the planning of projects is that one should rather talk about messages rather than structures.
