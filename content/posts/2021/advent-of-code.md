summary: After I haven't written anything here for a long time, okay a very long time, I don't want to let this blog fall asleep completely. A lot has happened to me recently, which is why I haven't found much time to write. But now, at christmas time, I would like to slowly start again.

After I haven't written anything here for a long time, okay a very long time, I don't want to let this blog fall asleep completely. A lot has happened to me recently, which is why I haven't found much time to write. But now, at christmas time, I would like to slowly start again.

Today I would like to introduce you to a small project for the Advent season. The project is called "[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)". The Advent of Code is an advent calendar with a little christmas story. Behind each door there are two small tasks that have to be solved with the help of a programming language of your choice - it can even be a new programming language. You get a star for each task and the story is complete by christmas.

The Advent of Code exists since 2015 and it is fun to open the doors every year. Anyone who enjoys programming should definitely take a look at the calendar and start opening the first doors. Even now, on 7 December, it's not too late, you can still open the first doors without any problems. You can also still solve the puzzles from previous years. So there is absolutely no reason to be bored during the christmas time.

If you would like to keep a private leaderboard with me, please feel free to contact me. But for now, have fun solving the puzzles and have a wonderful Advent season!
